# ADJOINT2025_Fivefolds
Repository for applying the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal to smooth projective toric Fano 5-folds to check for full strong exceptional collection of line bundles

An in-progress version of Jay Yang's HHLResolutions package is available via HHLResolutions.zip.

Macaulay2 code to iterate over the M2 database of smooth projective toric Fano 5-folds and apply the HHL resolution (using Jay Yang's HHLResolutions package), then checking for an FSEC of LB's is available in "ReUpdatedCode_dim5.docx". 

Final output is stored in "Dim5Indices00to865."
